If you downloaded the D2X modes from Nikon you may have noticed the noise at
ISO 400 or even ISO 200\. Many people seem to use D2Xmode1 for portraits and
D2Xmode3 for nature and landscape photography. Someone on the
[dpreview.com](http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/) suggested to use the
following settings:

  * Picture Control: Neutral
  * Sharpening +6
  * Contrast +1
  * Brightness -1
  * Saturation +1
  * Hue +1

The result is simply stunning. Nearly no noise anymore, even in heavily
cropped images, perfect detail and colours.
