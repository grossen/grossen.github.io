The travelogue pages have their pictures restored… All links are working
again…

I still think for a single user blog or website Wordpress is better & far
easier to configure, but it was a nice experiment and so far I really like
Drupal.

Wordpress features I'll miss a lot:

  * automatic updates of plugins and core
  * NextGEN gallery
  * themes

Drupal features I really like:

  * Views module
  * Image_Field module
