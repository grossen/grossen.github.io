Don't get me wrong, [Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) was - and still is - a
fine tool to create many kinds of websites, but the lack of good themes was
bothering me. So i had two choices: keep searching for a nice Drupal theme or
creating one myself, which meant that i had to get my hands dirty on things
like [CSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Css), Drupal
[api's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api),â€¦

So, why not take the big splash and learn something completely new. I was
always interested in technologies like [XML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml)
and [XSLT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xslt), so i was delighted to find a
CMS which is build around this standards: [Symphony CMS](http://symphony-
cms.com).

So far it has been a great ride, most of the functionality of the old Drupal
and Wordpress versions of this site has been migrated and i have finally found
a framework which makes it very easy to seamless include services like
Twitter, Flickr and Last.fm.
