It seems like Sun made a right choice hiring Ian Murdock. I installed
OpenSolaris last night in a VMware Fusion instance, and it looks sweet: bash
is the default shell, seperate /root home directory, live cd which acts as a
install cd, ZFS, Xen, DTrace, Containers, a new package management system
[IPS](http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Project%2Bpkg/WebHome). Now if only
Sun could do something about the lack of hardware support.
