I'm migrating my old [Wordpress](http://www.wordpress.org) site to a
[Drupal](http://www.drupal.org) based one. Currently there are a lot of broken
links, images are not appearing and the theme could use some improvement.

So far i'm quite impressed with the possibilities and features of Drupal,
although working with inline images and albums seems a bit clumsy (something
like the [NextGEN Gallery](http://alexrabe.de/wordpress-plugins/nextgen-
gallery/) module for Drupal would be very much appreciated.
