    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> was &ndash; and still is &ndash; a
fine tool to create many kinds of websites, but the lack of good themes was
bothering me. So i had two choices: keep searching for a nice Drupal theme or
creating one myself, which meant that i had to get my hands dirty on things
like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Css">CSS</a>, Drupal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api">api&rsquo;s</a>,â€¦</p>

<p>So, why not take the big splash and learn something completely new. I was
always interested in technologies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml">XML</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xslt">XSLT</a>, so i was delighted to find a
CMS which is build around this standards: <a href="http://symphony-%0Acms.com">Symphony CMS</a>.</p>

<p>So far it has been a great ride, most of the functionality of the old Drupal
and Wordpress versions of this site has been migrated and i have finally found
a framework which makes it very easy to seamless include services like
Twitter, Flickr and Last.fm.</p>
