    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It all started with WordPress&hellip;</p>

<p>After WordPress i migrated to Drupal, Sypmhony CMS, Textpattern, MODx and now
this site is running Plone.</p>

<p>While it has a steep learning curve, Plone is doing out of the box what i want
for this site, unlike the other CMS&rsquo;s where i needed a lot of
plugins/addons/extentions.</p>

<p>Textile markup, richt text editor, multimedia handling, integrated search,
photo albums, &hellip; all included.</p>

<p>One aspect Plone really needs to improve though, is theming. For simple
designs, like this site, you can quite easily override some of the CSS, but
advanced styling means deep diving into the bowels of Plone and Zope. Or as an
alternative: using a theme transformer such as Diazo or Deliverance.</p>

<p>Coming next: some small guides how to adapt the standard Plone install and
theme into something similar to this site.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> was &ndash; and still is &ndash; a
fine tool to create many kinds of websites, but the lack of good themes was
bothering me. So i had two choices: keep searching for a nice Drupal theme or
creating one myself, which meant that i had to get my hands dirty on things
like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Css">CSS</a>, Drupal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api">api&rsquo;s</a>,…</p>

<p>So, why not take the big splash and learn something completely new. I was
always interested in technologies like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xml">XML</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xslt">XSLT</a>, so i was delighted to find a
CMS which is build around this standards: <a href="http://symphony-%0Acms.com">Symphony CMS</a>.</p>

<p>So far it has been a great ride, most of the functionality of the old Drupal
and Wordpress versions of this site has been migrated and i have finally found
a framework which makes it very easy to seamless include services like
Twitter, Flickr and Last.fm.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The travelogue pages have their pictures restored… All links are working
again…</p>

<p>I still think for a single user blog or website Wordpress is better &amp; far
easier to configure, but it was a nice experiment and so far I really like
Drupal.</p>

<p>Wordpress features I&rsquo;ll miss a lot:</p>

<ul>
<li>automatic updates of plugins and core</li>
<li>NextGEN gallery</li>
<li>themes</li>
</ul>


<p>Drupal features I really like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Views module</li>
<li>Image_Field module</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m migrating my old <a href="http://www.wordpress.org">Wordpress</a> site to a
<a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a> based one. Currently there are a lot of broken
links, images are not appearing and the theme could use some improvement.</p>

<p>So far i&rsquo;m quite impressed with the possibilities and features of Drupal,
although working with inline images and albums seems a bit clumsy (something
like the <a href="http://alexrabe.de/wordpress-plugins/nextgen-%0Agallery/">NextGEN Gallery</a> module for Drupal would be very much appreciated.</p>
